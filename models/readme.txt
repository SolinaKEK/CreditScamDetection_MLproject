Model versions are as follows:

1. Results from original, baseline training
2. Results from training with random undersampling
3. Results from training with random oversapling
4. Results from training with SMOTE
5. Results from RUS + SMOTE
6. Hyperparamter tuning (regularization, epochs, neural architecture, batch size, etc)
7. Normalization
8. '*model_best' best performing version of each model type.
